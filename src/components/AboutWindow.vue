      <p class="text-lg">
        I'm a passionate junior software developer with a love for creating clean, efficient code.
        My journey in tech started with a curiosity about how computers work, and now I'm turning
        that curiosity into a career.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg">
        When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new technologies, contributing to open-source
        projects, or playing retro video games.
